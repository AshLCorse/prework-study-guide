##Description

study guide for DU coding bootcamp

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

~
I wanted a study guide for my first coding bootcamp.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

~
I was provided a guide to build this project, and followed it while making it my own. I built this because I want to keep using it during the bootcamp, and further customize it to my needs.

- What problem does it solve?

~
This project puts my notes in an easy to read format, online, with the ability to easily edit and add customization. That solves the issue of having to write physical notes, store them, or make a different virtual notes system that might not work as well, or be as easy to customize.

- What did you learn?

~
Doing this project taught me some new HTML code, and some new CSS features. I learned how to use JavaScript with Chrome console, which was exciting! I have gotten much more used to Git Bash through this project. I learned to navigate and use my command terminal much more effectively. I also found that putting my notes in after practicing and learning new code was very helpful for me to remember everything I learned.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

~
I use this webpage to access helpful notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I also use it to test and practice with those 4 topics.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

~
I followed a guide from the DU coding bootcamp.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

~
MIT License, as stated in the REPO.git

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
